# Zero-Knowledge File Vault 

A secure file storage application where encryption and decryption happen entirely on the client side, ensuring the server never has access to plaintext data or keys.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Crypto: AES (CryptoJS)
- Backend: (planned) FastAPI / Node.js
- Storage: (planned) Object storage

## Current Status
- Client-side file encryption implemented
- Upload/download flow in progress
- Backend API under development

## Learning Goals
- Applied cryptography basics
- Secure client-server design
- Threat modeling
